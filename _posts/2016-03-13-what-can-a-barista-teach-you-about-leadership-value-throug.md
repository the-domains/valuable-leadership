# [What Can a Barista Teach You About Leadership - Value Through a Gold Filter][0]

##   

**Personal Values**

The
second store I worked in was in the terminal of a very busy commuter 
train station. The morning rush brought waves of commuters who would 
pack the store for 20 minutes or so. The store had a great crew. We'd 
surf those waves, have fun and deliver the Starbucks Experience to 
hundreds of people an hour. Between the waves we'd scramble to get ready
for the next onslaught. It was crazy, but we delivered value and the 
experience customers sought, at least most of the time.

Value is a
great concept. It's personal, subjective and appropriately biased. Some
people value low cost, others the best service, or maybe a reputable 
brand. Each of us gets to decide what we value, what's important. In 
social considerations, whether global, national, organizational or 
personal configurations, we often look for common values, but each of us
gets to decide what we value individually.

Late one morning, as 
the waves lengthened out, I was out front cleaning the condiment bar 
when an irate customer approached me. He was yelling at me about how we 
ripped him off on a coffee maker. I think he valued being right.

**Sphere of Influence**

By
that time in my life I had spent plenty of days behind a retail 
counter. I knew that the customer wasn't really always right. They do 
have the power and prerogative of paying or voting with their feet (or 
these days with thumbs on a mobile device). This guy had bought a little
counter top coffee maker. When he got it home he was frustrated because
the gold filter wasn't in the box. I used my skills to try and lower 
the heat. I paraphrased, spoke in a calming voice, and explained that 
the gold filter didn't come with the coffee maker. It was extra, priced 
about the same as the machine, and I explained the great features and 
benefits.

He was fit to be tied, screaming at me. I kept at it 
with my calm tone and asked him "what would make you enthusiastically 
satisfied now?" Back in the day, one of the corporate values expected 
was "enthusiastically satisfied customers all of the time." He said I 
should give him "the @&!\#%! filter!" I thought I knew what Howard 
Schultz expected of me. Embedded in those guiding principles was a 
target, a goal - to _create enthusiastically satisfied customers_.
I gave him a smile, the gold filter and a "Starbuck" for a 
complimentary cup to use whenever he wanted. He left with what seemed to
be a huff. 

As we all know, the company grew from a small chain 
back then in to a Fortune 500, globally respected brand. One pillar of 
that dominance was the bloom of the idea that inspired staff to create 
"enthusiastically satisfied customers all of the time." 

It was 
long ago that I gave away the gold filter. I have no idea if that fella 
ever used the free coffee coupon, shopped at Starbucks ever again, or 
bad mouthed the company.  He was gone. His return, and his enthusiasm 
were well beyond my influence. I couldn't control his response or 
satisfaction. The notions of who might be 'right' or 'wrong' didn't seem
on point. 

**My Value**

What was on point was that the target - _enthusiastically satisfied customers all of the time_
- was about me. It was about my role in customer service, not about a 
guy who had already left the store. What mattered was how I showed up, 
especially in the thousands interactions that followed that particularly
unpleasant one. I think that silly old filter delivered unbelievable 
ROI over the years. It motivated me to bring authenticity and alignment 
to my role and deliver outstanding results. I went on to develop a slice
of sales, stores, markets and leaders over the next few years. 

**Leadership Lesson**

I
realized that creating the legendary Starbucks customer experience was 
in part, about applying talent and aligning effort with goals and 
values. It was about me, and the amazing people I got to work with. It 
was most certainly not about things that were beyond my control. I 
learned that leadership emanates from how I show up and what I do to 
influence the creation of value. How are you showing up? Are your 
actions and behaviors aligned and creating the value you want and that 
your organization needs?
