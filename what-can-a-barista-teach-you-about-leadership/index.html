ago. Not only did my part-time gig pay over minimum wage and provide 
healthcare benefits, I got as much free coffee as I could handle! Back 
then Starbucks had less than 100 stores worldwide. In fact, there were 
stores in just 4 cities across North America, but customers had come to 
know their neighborhood store as "my Starbucks." At that time the buzz, 
that Howard Schultz was a great leader, was mostly confined internally 
within the company. </p><p>If someone leads, someone else follows. However, it seems society 
often holds the idea of followers with some pejorative or derogatory 
judgment. When I think of leadership, I think of Martin Chemers' idea 
expressed in <em>An Integrative Theory of Leadership</em> (1997) stating
 leadership is “a process of social influence in which one person can 
enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common 
task.” Any act of leadership requires a follower. </p><p><strong>It’s About the Experience</strong></p><p>A few months before I applied for the job, I had my first Starbucks
 experience. I had been complaining to a friend. Since I had moved from 
the West Coast back to Chicago it was impossible to find a good cup of 
coffee. He said, "try this new place, they're from Seattle, there's one 
on Halsted." I went there one morning just after 6 AM. The line was 
long, everyone seemed to be smiling, and I was so curious about the 
enthusiasm of the employees. Once that bold hot black liquid crossed my 
taste buds I thought, "I need stock in that company!” I didn’t realize 
it then, but that experience helped engage me as a follower and inspire 
me as a leader.</p><p>One lens for learning about leadership is examining how, why and 
what creates followers. People like to follow leaders that create value.
 Value engages people to have positive experiences. These valuable 
experiences often influence us to display leadership. We can become 
growth hackers that use the knowledge and experience to create value for
 others to follow. It's not only economic value. When we can give and 
get value, we feel valued. We feel happier, more innovative. This helps 
us to build upon success (value) and create more of it. When our 
communities build value, opportunity and potential grow and that creates
 space where others can follow, engage, innovate and create value. 
(Community value is a story for another post or several.)</p><p><strong>Deliver Value</strong></p><p>My first shift started at the crack of dawn one beautiful day in 
June. It was long before employee stock options or an IPO. The store 
couldn't have been more than 1000 sq. ft. I was blown away with how much
 coffee we pumped out of that little store. I was done at 11.30AM. The 
customer count was staggering, more than a sale per minute on average! 
Nearly everyone in the line, which extended past the door almost all 
morning, seemed thrilled to be there. I rode the "L" home, smelling of 
coffee, feeling intrigued and thinking, "What's the deal? Most of those 
hundreds of customers had to wait in a long line and pay more for their 
coffee yet they all seemed to find value in the experience."</p><p>Starbucks Coffee, through Schultz’s leadership, certainly found 
ways to be a social influence that created positive experiences for 
customers (followers). Sure the coffee was great, but that was just the 
common task, exchanging a great cup of coffee from barista to customer. 
We were engaged in an experience. Customers came, waited in long lines 
and paid handsomely because the experience had value for them. Employees
 (partners as we were called) followed Schultz’s leadership, finding 
value in being part of the experience. And back then, in those pre-IPO, 
innocent days of magnificent growth, many baristas, myself included, 
developed as leaders. Our customers followed and took some ownership as 
they declared, “That’s my Starbucks."</p><p><strong>The Leadership Lesson</strong> </p><picture>

<p>I learned that people get enthusiastically engaged, eager to follow the leader, take ownership and innovate, if they find value in the experience.
